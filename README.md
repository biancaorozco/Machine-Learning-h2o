- Data is Credit Loan Applications to a Bank. 

- Objective is to assess Risk Of Default, prevent bad loans, save bank lots of \$\$\$

- Best Kagglers got 0.80 AUC with more 100's of manhours, feature engineering, combining more data sets 

- We'll get 0.74 AUC in 30 minutes of coding (+1.5 hour of explaining)




## Data

- Kaggle Competition: [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)

- Data is large (166MB unzipped, 308K rows, 122 columns)



## Machine Learning With H2O

The goal of ___Machine Learning with H2O___ is to get you experience with:

1. The R programming language

2. `h2o` for machine learning

3. `lime` for feature explanation

4. `recipes` for preprocessing
